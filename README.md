# DevSecOps-Pipeline-Blueprint
This repository documents the DevSecOps Pipeline Blueprint, outlining the security-integrated CI/CD workflows for Application and Infrastructure Pipelines.  

## Overview
This blueprint defines an end-to-end DevSecOps process that integrates security at every stage of software development and infrastructure deployment.

It covers:
- Application Pipeline â€“ Secure application builds and deployments
- Infrastructure Pipeline â€“ Secure Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices
- Security Automation â€“ Continuous security scanning and monitoring

## Application Pipeline (CI/CD)

The Application Pipeline automates build, security, testing, and deployment workflows using AWS services.

ðŸ”¹Workflow Steps:

 - Code Commit â€“ Developers push code to AWS CodeCommit.

 - Build & Unit Test â€“ Uses Maven, Gradle, and testing frameworks (JUnit, Pytest).

 - Code Coverage Analysis â€“ Uses Jacoco, pytest-cov, OpenCover to ensure test quality.

 - Secrets Scanning â€“ git-secrets scans for exposed credentials.

 - Static Code Analysis (SAST) & Dependency Scanning â€“ Tools like Anchore, Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check ensure security.

 - Dynamic Code Analysis (DAST) â€“ OWASP ZAP performs real-world attack simulations.

 - Runtime Security (RASP) â€“ Falco monitors application behavior.

 - Manual Approval â€“ A review step before deployment.

 - Deployment (AWS CodeDeploy) â€“ Secure release with rolling updates or blue/green deployments.

 - Security Monitoring â€“ AWS CloudWatch, Lambda scan analysis, and Security Hub.


## Infrastructure Pipeline (IaC Security)

The Infrastructure Pipeline ensures secure Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) deployments.

ðŸ”¹Workflow Steps:

 - Code Commit â€“ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) is stored in AWS CodeCommit.

 - Linting & Security Analysis

    -> TFLint for Terraform best practices.
  
    -> Checkov & Terrascan for security misconfigurations.
   
 - Cost Estimation (Infracost) â€“ Generates reports on infrastructure costs.
   
 - Manual Approval â€“ Required before deploying changes.
   
 - Deployment (AWS CodeBuild) â€“ Secure provisioning of AWS resources.
   
 - Monitoring & Notifications
   
    -> AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure health.
   
    -> Slack Alerts via AWS Chatbot for pipeline status updates.
   
    -> AWS Security Hub for compliance monitoring.

## Folder Structure for Custom Scripts

```bash
ðŸ“¦ devsecops-pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ scripts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ trigger_pipeline.sh      # Triggers AWS CodePipeline
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security_scan.sh         # Runs SAST, DAST, and Secrets Scanning
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notify_slack.sh          # Sends pipeline status
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ container_scan.sh        # Runs Trivy for Docker image scanning
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ terraform_check.sh       # Runs Terraform security checks

```
